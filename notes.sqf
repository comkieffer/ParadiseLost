Cover_story_note = [
    "Cover",
    "You will be posing as a team of american geologists investigating potential oil and gas reserves in the region. No deep knowledge of geology or oil prospection is needed but we suggest you at least read the wikipedia articles on these subjects. <br/>"

Extraction_note = [
    "Extraction",
    "Once you have secured Mark Thompson mke your way back to Ovallestan and leave him under custody of the FAST team. You will then drop off your weapons at the cache before returning to the consulate. The helicopter you took on the way in will be waiting for you."

Enemy_forces_note = [
    "Enemy Forces",
    "The UN forces will be neutral in regards to foreigners. The civilians though might be less friendly. A violent demonstration has started in front of the American consulate in Ovallstan.<br/> Insurgents will be present in the countryside west of Ovallestan. The town of Demenazhir is a hotspot of insurgent activity and you should expect a strong insurgent presence in the town and it's suburbs. We can’t estimate enemy forces strength due to high connexion with civilians in the region. Be ready for an important enemy presence."
];

friendly_forces_note = [
    "Allied Forces",
    "CIA has mobilised it's HUMINT assets in the area and will forward any extra information they have on the situation. There is a FAST platoon of marines at the US consulate but they will only defend the embassy <br/> There will be no air support or UAV because of the UN no-fly-zone <br/> In a word : You’re on your own."

weather_notes = [
    "Meteo and terrain",
    "Terrain is usual Pakistani valley, but this is a heavily populated area so watch your fire. Because of all the fighting going on the locals are pretty insomniac. Don't be too quick to assume that any person taking a stroll at 3am is an enemy combattant ...<br/> We expect the weather to be calm and the sky clear. No wind."

Commander_intent_note = [
    "Commander intent",
    "The goal here is obvious : RESCUE the journalist. You haven’t been sent to eliminate taliban presence in Pakistan, so don’t overdo it.<br/> Stay alive, keep Thompson alive and extract ASAP.<br/><br/>Having the support of the local population is very important to us. The civilians and the local military are already pretty unhappy about the drone strikes, try to not anger them even more by killing civilians."
];
Weapons_cache_note = [
    "Weapons cache",
    "There are two SUVs parked in the consulate. You can take them. Ditch them if needed. The consul was extracted 2 days ago and won’t need them anymore. <br/> We have a weapon cache in Kespora [Gridref 143169]. You will find our agent, codename Pedro, there. He will provide you with everything you need. <br/>Be advised, he employs locals to manage security around his compound."
];

Explosion_note = [
    "EXPLOSION AT US CONSULATE",
    "All hell is breaking loose at the consulate ! There has been a massive explosion in front of the building in the middle of the crowd. Emergemcy services are overwhelmed. The local governement has declared martial law in the town. Nobody come in or out, it seems that the UN forces will be enforcing the rule so there is no way you will be able to get to the chopper without having to fight your way in. It is also extremely probable that the chopper has been damaged in the blast and will be unable to take off again. <br/> We are looking into alternative means of extraction.<br />Stand by for instructions."
];

Extraction_update_note = [
    "Extraction change",
    "We have confirmed that your helicopter is unable to take off. We are scrambling assets from the other side of the border to get you out. We should have a flight of Black Hawks in the air shortly. They will fly to a holding position on the other side of the Afghan side of the border and will maintain station until they hit bingo fuel. That leaves approx. 30 minutes of available time until you need to abort.<br />The flight is composed of Ghost 1 and Ghost 2. Ghost 1 will extract you whilst Ghost 2 provides top cover.<br/>The LZ is at gridref 090171.<br/><br/>If you are unable to be at the LZ by the time the choppers have to rtb you will have to walk to the border. The mountains between you and the border are an insurgent haven so expect heavy resistance."
